# Student-Managemant-System
 I am making a database and here I need to keep their Stud_ID, name, date of birth, subjects, fees, phone number, any provision of concession, and their academic progress for . My system has the following pieces of information :  ⨂ Student’s Name ⨂ Age ⨂ Student Id ⨂ Fees ⨂ Year ⨂ Phone number ⨂ Address ⨂ Subjects or course ⨂ Grades (or Marks) ⨂ Concessions (or Scholarships) ⨂ Additional Information.  --> Here the student ID, name and their full information which will be attached. where the ID of each student will be different. --> You will see how many marks or grades they have got in each subject. --> It will also be seen if they have any scholarships on the result.
